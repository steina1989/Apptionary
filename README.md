# Apptionary

This is a "pictionary-esque" game, where a group of users can play together in the same vicinity. One user draws on a canvas, and a corresponding canvas updates for other users. 

The goal is guessing which object is being drawn, and after the correct response has been yelled out the user who's drawing can press a button and give points to one player. 

The game doesn't end till the fun is dun (*done)!
